In this lab, you will develop preliminary hypotheses and use your data to run preliminary regressions. Completing this lab will get you much closer to completing your projects.

# Getting Started

## Export data from your data proposal

1.  Go back to your data proposal homework and add the following code block to **the end** of the RMarkdown file:

```{r export, eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
write_csv(mydata, "mydata.csv")
```

2.  Replace "mydata" with the name of your final dataframe in the homework.
3.  Run the codeblock. If you get an error: first, check that you typed the name correctly; second, make sure you see the dataframe in your environment pane. If it's not there, go ahead and knit the document.
4.  Click the checkmark next to "mydata.csv" then export it exactly as you've done for html files and PDFs in our other labs.

## Import data into your Final Project

1.  Find and open the new "Final Project" assignment in RStudio Cloud.
2.  Click on the "data" folder in the files pane
3.  Click "Upload" and upload mydata.csv
4.  Navigate out of the data folder
5.  Open "Lastname_Firstname - HW04 - Final Project Lab.rmd"
6. Continue with the lab
