## Social Research
::: incremental
- What is social research? 
    - Attempt by social scientists to develop and sharpen our understanding of human society and social relationships
- Why do we engage in social research?  
:::

## Normative vs. Empirical Research
::: incremental
- **Normative research** seeks to answer questions about how the world *should* or *ought* to be
    - Philosophical, based on values, subjective
    - Example: what is the best management style?
- **Empirical research** seeks to answer questions about how the world *is*
    - Factual, based on observation (data), (more) objective
    - Example: what management style optimizes employee retention?
:::


## Basic vs. Applied Research
::: incremental
- **Basic research** seeks to develop new knowledge about the nature of phenomena
    - Innate curiosity
    - Example: why are people violent?
- **Applied research** seeks to answer specific questions about real-world problems and their solutions
    - Problem solving
    - Example: how do we reduce violence in schools?
:::

## Descriptive vs. Explanatory Research
::: incremental
- **Descriptive research** seeks to characterize the nature of a problem of phenomena.
    - Example: how pervasive is school violence?
- **Explanatory research** seeks to explain the causes of a problem or phenomena and/or the effectiveness of particular solutions
    - Example(s):
        - What causes school violence?
        - Do metal detectors reduce the likelihood of school violence?

## Research Process

## Research Question
![](images/researchquestion.png)

## Research Question
::: incremental
- The question you plan to answer in a given study
- Can be challenging---should be narrow enough to answer in a given study, but broad enough to matter
    - Too broad: How can we reduce recidivism in the US? 
    - Too narrow: What was the recidivism rate in the US in 2014?
    - Just right: Do work release programs reduce recidivism? 
:::

## Review Previous Research

## Review Previous Research 
::: incremental
- Place your research within the context of existing scholarship---what do we know and what do we need to know about the relationship between work release programs and recidivism?
    - Have other scholars addressed the question?
        - If so, what did they find and what are you adding to their findings?
    - Do theories/findings exist in other areas of research (i.e., private sector business management) that might speak to your question?
        - If so, what are those theories/findings and how might they relate to your question?
:::

## Develop Theory 
![](images/researchtheory.png)

## Develop Theory
- Set of interrelated propositions that seek to explain and, in some cases, predict an observed phenomenon
    - Participation in work release program $\Rightarrow$ job skills $\Rightarrow$ more likely to secure job after release $\Rightarrow$ reduced likelihood of recidivism 

## Develop Theory
::: incremental
- Good theories are:
    1. Accurate---consistent with reality
    2. Generalizable---applicable to a wide variety of cases
    3. Productive---generate testable(falsifiable) hypotheses
::: 

## Develop Theory
::: incremental
- Where does theory come from?
    1. Logic (deduction)
    2. Observation (induction)
:::
    
## Construct Hypotheses
![](images/researchhypoth.png)

## Construct Hypotheses
::: incremental
- Specific statement about the expected relationship between the dependent (outcome) and independent (explanatory) variables in a theory
    - Dependent variables are affected by ("depend on") other variables; sometimes called outcome variables
    - Independent variables affect/explain/cause changes in dependent variables; sometimes called explanatory or treatment variables
    - Dependent variables (*y*) vary as a function of independent variables (*x*): *y=f(x)* or *y~x*
        - *Recidivism = f(Work Release Participation)* or *Recidivism~Work Release Participation*
::: 

## Construct Hypotheses
::: incremental
- Good hypotheses...
    - Match the theory
    - Specify the expected direction of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables (positive or negative)
    - Are falsifiable---clear enough to be wrong!
- Example: if my theory is correct, then...
    - *H: Prisoners participating in work release programs will be less likely to return to prison than those who do not participate.*

## Tips for Surviving as you Learn R
- Take your time
- Make mistakes 
- Take notes 
- Google your problems (or ask ChatGPT with caution)
