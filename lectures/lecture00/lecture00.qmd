## Introductions

-   Name
-   Program (MPA, PhD, nondegree, etc.)
-   Policy interest(s) (e.g., environment, education, health, etc.)
-   Bonus: If you could get your hands on any kind of dataset (real or imagined), what would it be and why? (could the dataset help solve a problem? provide insight into something we don't know very much about?)

## What we're doing in this course

\Pr(Y_i = j \mid Z_i = z) =

## What we're actually doing

This...

```{r}
#| echo: false
idaho_county_merged <- read_csv("data/idaho_county_merged.csv")
```

```{r}
#| label: compute
#| include: false
prescounties <- ggplot(
  data = idaho_county_merged,
  mapping = aes(x = pct_collegeE, y = median_incomeE, color = win_candidate)
) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Idaho Counties: Education and Median Income",
    subtitle = "Linear relationship between education and income",
    x = "Pct Adults w/ Bachelor's Degree or Higher",
    y = "Median Income",
    color = "Winning Pres. Candidate (2020)",
    caption = "Source: Education & income: U.S. Census Bureau; Voting: Harvard Dataverse"
  )  +
 scale_color_manual(values = c("blue","red"))
```

```{r}
#| label: compute2
#| include: false
counties <- ggplot(
  data = idaho_county_merged,
  mapping = aes(x = pct_collegeE, y = median_incomeE)
) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Idaho Counties: Education and Median Income",
    subtitle = "Linear relationship between education and income",
    x = "Pct Adults w/ Bachelor's Degree or Higher",
    y = "Median Income",
    caption = "Source: Education & income: U.S. Census Bureau"
  )
```

```{r}
#| ref.label: compute2
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
```

## ...to turn this

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
# Show a small preview so the table fits nicely on a slide
head(idaho_county_merged, 10)
```

## Into this!

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 5
counties
```

## Or this!

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-width: 9
#| fig-height: 5
prescounties
```

## Or this!

```{r}
#| label: compute3
#| include: false
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)

idaho_county_merged <- idaho_county_merged %>%
  mutate(
    county_label = word(NAME, 1)
  )

p <- ggplot(
  idaho_county_merged,
  aes(x = pct_collegeE, y = median_incomeE,
      color = win_candidate, size = total_populationE)
) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(
    aes(label = county_label),
    size = 3,
    max.overlaps = Inf,   
    box.padding = 0.3,    
    point.padding = 0.5,  
    segment.color = "grey50",
    show.legend = FALSE
  ) +
  scale_size_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +

## Can/Should I use AI in this course?

-   YES... BUT sparingly at first while you learn to code
- I use it daily
- It can be a great time saver/helper/troubleshooter when it comes to coding
- You should DEFINITELY be using it

## AI and your brain

![](images/clipboard-867447823.png)


## AI and this course
- It can basically do everything in the class for you... But
  - It frequently overcomplicates or gets things wrong 
  - If you don't know how to code, you might not know there's a problem and/or might not know how to fix it (or ask it to fix it)


## AI and this course
- You have an opportunity to grow your skills well beyond what we do in class this semester. 
- Over-reliance on AI will rob you of that opportunity. You're investing a tremendous amount of your time to this course and your education, generally.
- If you can't do anything more than what AI/LLM can do then it CAN replace you
